# Goals

- Examine callbacks in context of asynchronicity
- Understand role of promises
- Understand role of *async / await*
- See common patterns and how to solve with *async / await*

## Callbacks Will Always Be Useful

First two cases will always be done with callbacks:

- Functional programming patterns,
- Event-driven programming

Let's talk about third case, for handling asynchronicity
